Installing IgBlast
Downloading the executable files from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/<version_number> is not sufficient for a working IgBlast installation. You must also download the internal_data directory (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/internal_data) and put it into the same directory as the igblast executable. This is also described in the igblast README file.
You should also ensure to set the $IGDATA environment variable to point to the location of the IgBlast executable. For example run export IGDATA=/<path_to_igblast>/igblast/1.4.0/bin.
